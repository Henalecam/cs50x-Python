Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

In 2019w seems like england and united states can't decide which have more chance to win

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

112500, because it consumes almost exactly 1 second.
